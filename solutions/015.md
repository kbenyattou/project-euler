In an m x n grid, whichever path we take will involve m movements to the right and n movements down. We can write the path taken P as a string of m steps down D and n steps rights R. This means that P is a string of length (m + n).

For a single path through the grid, once we place the R's the D's placements have already been chosen (they can't go anywhere else).

Thus, we only need to know how many ways we can place the n R's in P. This is given by the binomial coefficient "m+n choose n" = (m+n)!/(n!(m+n-n)!). Now take m = n = 20 to get (40!)/((20!)^2).
