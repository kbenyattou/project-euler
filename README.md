# project-euler

ProjectEuler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

This section is dedicated to archiving my solutions.
 - I’ve set myself a goal to solve the first 50 problems from the archives.
 - An acceptable runtime is ~60 seconds.
 - I’ll be using Python to solve these problems.
